# Nifty Crawler 

Nifty Crawler is an open source project whose purpose is to bring trust in the world of digital assets, analyzing all NFT smart contracts in order to verify whether the coined NFTs are centralized or decentralized and if the related files are available or not.

Each NFT is a collection of metadata. This metadata is not always visible to users and buyers.

This lack of visibility limits trust in the market and in the players who populate it. A market without trust will not be able to expand to its maximum potential and will always be full of bad actors who can carry out illegal actions.

The blockchain was created to bring trust where it is lacking. Therefore NFTs could be a positive tool if used correctly.

The other important aspect to consider is the decentralization of the files connected to the NFTs.

Today, most of the files related to NFTs are stored offchain. This severely limits trust.
However, it is possible to choose solutions that, although not perfect, allow you to keep files in decentralized storage, such as using IPFS.

To date, a first analysis of the best-known smart contracts has identified that 69% of NFTs are centralized.
Centralized storage, such as on AWS or other storage service providers, while more efficient solutions do not give the market the confidence that it should be: what happens if a server is not paid for? Or if it gets hacked? All NFTs present would be compromised, thus leading to considerable damage to the owners, as well as to the entire world of crypto art.



How Nifty Crawler works?

Selecting a Smart Contract you get the list of all the NFTs present.

For each NFT the following are displayed:
- The Smart Contract address, with the link to Etherscan
- The Token ID
- The Token URI, which allows you to read the NFT metadata
- The type of Media, which allows you to download the media via the browser
- The state of decentralization of the NFT
- The state of decentralization of the Media

Nifty Crawler next steps
Here is a list of some of the features we are planning to introduce, step by step:

    • Automatic scan of all ERC721 / ERC1155 smart contracts and of their NFTs
    • Add more blockchains, starting with Polygon, BSC and other EVM compatible blockchains and then proceed with Wax, Flare and others
    • Browser extension
    • Data analysis and reports
    • Double minting explorer, on same blockchain or more blockchains
    • Copy-theft explorer, on same blockchain or more blockchains using AI algorithms 
    • Users onboarding with wallet
    • Blog and wiki for deploying better Smart Contracts and minting better NFTs
